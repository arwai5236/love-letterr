  <h1>To My Sweetheart ❤️</h1>

  <p>Hey sweetheart, I love you so much and I’m so proud of you for how far you’ve come. Today marks our two months together, and I’m so happy I got to spend them with you — my light and joy, my baby.</p>

  <p>I love you so much, and I’m so glad to have you in my life. You mean everything to me, and I’d do anything in the universe for you because you bring me so much happiness and joy. I’m beyond grateful that I met you and stayed with you.</p>

  <p>You have my heart and soul tied to you in a way no one ever has before. My baby, you’ve shown me so much love, support, and care in these two months — more than anyone has in years — and I’m so fucking grateful for it.</p>

  <p>In just two months, I’ve felt like I’ve known you for years. And I hope to know you for years more. I hope to have a future with you. A home. A life. Everything.</p>

  <p>You are genuinely the prettiest, most precious girl ever. You deserve the world because you’re so sweet, kind, and caring toward everyone. You have the sweetest personality, the purest heart and soul. You light up my world with your stunning smile and your beautiful eyes that make me want to get lost in them forever and never find my way back.</p>

  <p>I’m so obsessed with you, to a point I can’t even understand. You, my princess, have me in a way no one else ever has — and no one ever will. You’re so special to me, and I never want to lose that.</p>

  <p>And baby — never, ever doubt your looks. You’re my pretty girl. You make everyone else look unattractive. You’re genuinely so beautiful in a way that takes my breath away. You’re gorgeous, sweetheart, and you should embrace that fully.</p>

  <p>I feel like I’m yapping a lot, but I want this to be long because you deserve it. I love expressing myself with you — it’s the best feeling ever. Whenever we talk, I get all stupid, giggly, and smiley. You bring that out of me.</p>

  <p>Whenever you call me by a nickname or baby me, I feel sparks and butterflies. I’m literally so in love with you — it’s crazy. And I’m so glad I’m in love with you. It’s the best feeling I’ve ever had.</p>

  <p>Anyway, I’ll stop yapping and start working on gifts because you deserve them all.</p>

  <p><strong>I LOVE YOU AND HAPPY TWO MONTHS, MWAHHHHH 💋💞</strong></p>
